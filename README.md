# YouTube-Channel-Analysis
I recently completed a dynamic data analysis project centered around the YouTube channel 'Twirl with BTS.' Leveraging the YouTube API, I meticulously prepared a dataset capturing key metrics and trends associated with the channel. The dataset was then meticulously analyzed using advanced techniques. To enhance the interpretability of the findings, I employed Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool. The result is a visually compelling representation of insights and patterns within the data. This project showcases my proficiency in data preparation, analysis, and visualization, providing a holistic view of my skills in the realm of data analytics.
